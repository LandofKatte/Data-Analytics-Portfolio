# Judo Breakdown

## Purpose:
  About a month ago, I became brave enough to sign up to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo. I am in awe of all the higher belts knowledge (kindness and patience toward me as a brand new white belt, too).  I am slowly working my way towards my first belt promotion (green belt) and some of the important things to know is the history of judo and the Japanese words. Therefore, what better way to learn it than to make a visualization.
 
  Although I have a very long time to go in my journey, the more I learned the more I became curious to see at higher levels and competitions what other people gravitated towards for techniques.


## Process:
  Asking a question: 
  With all research, I needed a purpose. What did I want to learn or know?
