# BJJ Breakdown

## Purpose:
  About a month ago, I became brave enough to sign up to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo. I am in awe of all the higher belts knowledge (kindness and patience toward me as a brand new white belt, too). I have a very long time to go in my journey, however, the more I learned the more I became curious to see at higher levels and competitions what other people gravitated towards for techniques (sweeps, guard passes, submissions, etc.). 

## Process:
  Asking a question: 
  With all research, I needed a purpose. What did I want to learn or know?
